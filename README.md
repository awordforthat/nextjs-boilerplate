# Next JS Boilerplate project

This project serves as a template for NextJS projects. It wraps the following tools:

1. NextJS
2. Typescript
3. Eslint
4. Stylelint
5. Prettier
6. Sass

To use this, clone the repo as a template, run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all dependencies, and edit away!

## Running the project
Some scripting is provided out of the box (examples are with yarn, but npm will work as well).

- Run `yarn next dev` to run the dev server (served on localhost:3000)
- Run `yarn next build` to create a build for production.
- Run `yarn next start` to run an optimized production version of the code.
- Run `yarn next lint` to run the preinstalled linting packages.
